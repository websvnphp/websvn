CHANGES

1.61

NEW: Multibyte encodings are considered when urlencoding path names

CHANGE: The listing view will now always show the revision asked for
        (HEAD by default), but the log message will show the log 
        string for the latest modification to the current directory).
        This means the the parent directory structure won't change as you
        browse through old directories.

FIX: A bug prevented downloading of tarballs from working

1.60 

NEW: Directory displays are now shown in tree view (so that it's harder
     to get lost).  Many thanks to Brent Lu for this excellent patch.
     The prettiest result are available in the BlueGrey scheme.
NEW: Comparison of entire directories
NEW: Tarballs of directories may now be downloaded.
     Set $config->allowdownload(); in config.inc to allow this.
NEW: New style 'Zinn' based on the templates created for
     http://www.projectzinn.org/.  Thanks to Justin Doran.
NEW: File delivery now looks at the defined Mime-Type.  Thanks to
     Peter Valdemar Mørch for this patch.

     basis.  Look in distconfig for instructions.
NEW: Support for using 'bugtraq' properties when display log entries.
     See http://svn.collab.net/repos/tortoisesvn/trunk/doc/issuetrackers.txt
NEW: Traditional Chinese translation
NEW: Spanish translation
     
CHANGE: Style information removed from RSS feed
CHANGE: Changed files are now hidden by defaut (since the directory
        comparison link is far more useful)

FIX: File listing were't being shown with the correct accented characters
     under windows.
FIX: File listing sometimes failed when there were spaces in the filename
FIX: Some setups wouldn't allow diff generations with enscript
     enabled.
FIX: Filenames are URL encoded correctly before calling svn file:///
FIX: Keywords weren't expanded in file view when enscript was disabled

1.51

NEW: Korean translation
NEW: Russian translation

FIX: Repositories may now have spaces in their path (eg: c:\my reps)
FIX: Diff now works when the file name has changed between versions
FIX: RSS feed now generates Content-Type header for XML so that IE can display
     the contents
FIX: Diff and Blame didn't work properly for php files when enscript wasn't used
FIX: Use svn --non-interactive to ensure that svn doesn't prompt WebSVN for input
FIX: Corrections to the French translation
FIX: Display an explanatory message when the user hasn't configured any
     repository paths
FIX: When using Multiviews, change to the WebSVN directory before executing
     commands so that tempnam works.  This used to cause problems on some
     systems when running diff and blame.

1.50

Notes: Before installing this version you should delete all the existing
       cache files.
       
       wsvn.php has changed.  You should redo any appropriate configuration
       changes inside this file.

NEW: Blame information for a file can now be viewed
NEW: The cached files are now compressed
NEW: The project selection box shows the current project by default
NEW: Swedish translation

NEW: The install file explains how to set up permission based repository
     access such that access via the web interface is the same as access
     via a client (assuming Apache2).
NEW: SVN keywords are now expanded in file listings

CHANGE: The extraction of the directory listings is now accomplished using
        the svn command via file:/// access rather than svnlook.  This has
        the advantage of being non-recursive, and thereby eliminates the need
        for caching the entire directory listing, and is much quicker on
        complex direcory structures. No more 50Mb directory caches!
        
FIX: Deleted directories are now viewable.
FIX: SHOWALL was being redefined in the language files
FIX: The directory listing view sometimes showed [lang:DELETEDFILES
FIX: Under Windows, links in the RSS output would start with "\" if WebSVN
     was installed in the server's root directory.
FIX: Sed wouldn't work under all versions of Windows due to the use of single
     quotes around the paramters
FIX: Improved character encoding support for log messages etc.
FIX: Paths passed by URL are encoded
FIX: Generated HTML code is strictly 4.01

NEW: Recognised links are now 'linkified' in the log messages
NEW: Tabs in file/diff listings are now expanded by a user
     configurable number of spaces. 
NEW: WebSVN URLs now access the repository by name rather than number.
     This means that bookmarks will stay the same when new projects
     are added.  The old behaviour can be configured in config.inc.

FIX: Removed the revision 0 that has appeared since the previous version
FIX: Repositories were not sorted alphabetically when using ParentPath

     now only loaded with IE

        47 hours, 13 days or 23 months before moving up to the next
        quantity, like ViewCVS.

FIX: Links followed after viewing the contents of a file go to the 
     revision of the repository previously being viewed
FIX: Paths with spaces are now correctly showed in the log view
FIX: Blank lines in the diff output are set to &nbsp; so the browser
     won't compress them
FIX: A blank author field is set to an &nbsp; cell.
FIX: A year is 365 days, not 356.
FIX: Base ages correctly upon GMT
FIX: The diff output did not escape html entities when enscript was
     enabled and the file extension was not recognised for enscript.

        a save box only if they can't be displayed in this mannor.

FIX: Detect use of the HTTPS protocol when using the drop-down box to
     select projects. (-- FIX INCORRECT. USE v1.36 -- )

        changes associated with it. A specific revision can still be
        selected from a log view
CHANGE: Only show the leaf name when viewing directory contents

     has been viewed subsequent revisions use the cached infomation to

order to make it more "future proof" and resiliant.  You'll need to copy
distconfig.inc to config.inc redo the appropriate changes are described.

NEW: A 'ParentPath' can now be specified, rather than having to specify the
     directories by hand.

FIX: Rewrite of the file list code.  Should now be quite a bit faster

FIX: Spaces in Windows path to svnlook and diff are now handled properly
FIX: Calls to external commands such as svnlook no longer require Windows
     style line endings.

     initial installation problems.
