CHANGES
NEW: New default template theme offered by Erik Pöhler

NEW: Russian translation.

CHANGE: Bugtraq handling has been updated to account for the latest spec.

FIX: Syntax highlighting across lines has been fixed (Issue 85)

CHANGE: Remove path comparison boxes when using the flat view display
CHANGE: Tidy up URLs generated from the listing view (Remove default parameters).
CHANGE: wsvn now selectes either the listing or file view automatically when the op parameter
        isn't present.  This allows for nicer URLS (eg. /http://example.com/wsvn/repo1/myfile.doc)
        
FIX: Fix warnings when using an access file that didn't define a groups section
FIX: Fix tarballing of directories with spaces
FIX: Path history information in the log view of a file was incorrect.

2.00 beta 7

NEW: Projects may now be assigned to groups, to simplify the index view
NEW: The index may be displayed as a collapsable tree of groups

CHANGE: The syntax for the per repository configurations has changed.  It's now much simpler and
        will work on all versions of PHP

FIX: Various bug fixes for the access rights module
FIX: Language choice selection with MultiViews enabled didn't work
FIX: Various small bugs introduced during 2.0 development

2.00 beta 6

Note: the $config->addRepository command now takes a URL and not a filesystem path!

NEW: WebSVN can now host remote repositories!

FIX: The access rights handling didn't work if you had give a repository a display name
     different from it's "real" svn name.
FIX: The deleted file list no longer links to non-existant files!
FIX: Neaten the directory display when the download/compare links aren't available

2.00 beta 5

NEW: Access rights files can now be specified on a per repository basis

CHANGE: Further improvements have been made to character encoding handling.  In particular,
        it is now possible to specify the encoding of the repository contents separately 
        from the system encoding.  This is the case for windows users, whereby the command
        line tools typically returning CP850 encoded strings, whereas the source files are
        encoded as iso-8859-1.  Now, when displaying text files, WebSVN will convert them
        from the content encoding to the output encoding (UTF-8).

CHANGE: Update Danish translation
CHANGE: The log display has a "max number of revisions to show" fiter option, which defaults
        to 30.  This significantly improves performance of the log display.

FIX: Correct problem with download of tarballs containing special characters

     depth and directories can be allow/disallowed on a per directory/repository basis.
NEW: The user can now choose their language via a drop down box

CHANGE: Character encodings are now handled differently.  The output encoding is ALWAYS
        defined as UTF-8, and the setOutputEncoding option has been removed.

FIX: Diff had been broken by 1.70 beta 2
FIX: Download of tarballs is prohibited if the user doesn't have read access to the directory
     AND all of its subdirectories
FIX: The character set type is now sent in the HTTP header.  No need to hack the Apache config

        browse through old directories.

FIX: A bug prevented downloading of tarballs from working

1.50

Notes: Before installing this version you should delete all the existing
       cache files.
       
       wsvn.php has changed.  You should redo any appropriate configuration
       changes inside this file.

NEW: Blame information for a file can now be viewed

NEW: The project selection box shows the current project by default

     via a client (assuming Apache2).
NEW: SVN keywords are now expanded in file listings

CHANGE: The extraction of the directory listings is now accomplished using
        the svn command via file:/// access rather than svnlook.  This has
        the advantage of being non-recursive, and thereby eliminates the need
        for caching the entire directory listing, and is much quicker on
        complex direcory structures. No more 50Mb directory caches!
        
FIX: Deleted directories are now viewable.

     are added.  The old behaviour can be configured in config.php.

FIX: Removed the revision 0 that has appeared since the previous version
FIX: Repositories were not sorted alphabetically when using ParentPath
FIX: The PNG support script needed for IE (and the BlueGrey scheme) is
     now only loaded with IE

1.39

        47 hours, 13 days or 23 months before moving up to the next
