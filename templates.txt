
THE TEMPLATING SYSTEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everyone wants their view onto their SVN repository to fit in with their look
and feel.  With WebSVN's templating system this is very possible.

To create your own templates, you first need to change your config.inc file to
tell WebSVN where the templates are stored.  For example:

$config->setTemplatePath("./templates/Standard/");

This directory should contain at least the following files:

header.tmpl - Header templated included before any other
footer.tmpl - Footer templated included after any other

index.tmpl - The main project page template

directory.tmpl - Listing of a directory
log.tmple - Log of a directory or file
file.tmpl - Contents of a text file
diff.tmpl - Differences between text files

Each template file should be written in HTML, but is allowed to contain certain
WebSVN controls.  There are two control types, commands and variables.


COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~


There are a few commands available:

[websvn-test:varname]
...
[websvn-else]
...
[websvn-endtest]

If the variable is non-0 write out the first part else write out the second

---

[websvn-startlisting]
...
[websvn-endlisting]


Used in pages that contain listings of files, logs, etc.  Everything between
the controls is repeated for each item in the list

---

[websvn-getlisting] (used in file.tmpl only)
 
Get the contents of the file being viewed and output it exactly (surrounded
with <PRE> .. </PRE>).

NOTE:  Controls MUST appear on there own line.

VARIABLES
~~~~~~~~~

Variables are written in the form [websvn:varname] where varname is the name of
a variable passed to the template.  The control is replaced with the variable
required.

The variables available are described below for each template.
You may also access the language file using [lang:varname] is order to keep your
templates international!

Take special notice of the use of the locwebsvnhttp variable.  It should be used
to locate other files and graphics that your templates need.  For example:

<link href="[websvn:locwebsvnhttp]/templates/tmptname/styles.css" ...

You may imagine that simply using . in place should work, however this isn't
the case when MultiViews are turned on.  Using this variable gives you a way to
access your template files in all cases.
